*DESCRIPTION:This internship task—focused on API integration and data visualization using Python—exemplifies this process. The main objective was to connect to a public API (specifically OpenWeatherMap), retrieve weather data for selected cities, and visualize that data using Python libraries like Matplotlib. This task demonstrates the use of key programming tools and libraries while showing how these skills can be implemented in real-world scenarios across various industries.

Tools Used
1. Python
Python is a powerful, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in data analysis, machine learning, automation, and web development. In this task, Python served as the foundation for connecting to APIs, processing the data, and generating visualizations. Its extensive library support made the entire workflow efficient and beginner-friendly.

2. OpenWeatherMap API
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a tool that allows different software systems to communicate. The OpenWeatherMap API is a public web service that provides access to weather-related data, including current conditions, forecasts, and historical records. In this project, the API was used to retrieve real-time weather information—such as temperature and humidity—for cities like Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Kolkata. To use the API, a free API key was obtained from the OpenWeatherMap website, which was then used to authenticate requests.

3. Requests Library
The requests library in Python is a popular tool used for sending HTTP requests. It enables seamless interaction with web APIs by allowing GET, POST, and other types of HTTP operations. In this task, requests.get() was used to send a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API. The server responded with data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, which is lightweight and easy to process in Python.

4. Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library in Python. It is commonly used to create static, animated, and interactive plots. For this project, Matplotlib was used to generate bar charts that displayed the temperature and humidity levels of multiple cities. The visualizations help translate numerical data into easily understandable graphical forms, which is especially useful for reports, dashboards, and presentations.

Where This Can Be Implemented
The skills and technologies demonstrated in this task have widespread real-world applications across various sectors:

1. Weather Applications
Weather forecasting apps and websites rely on similar API integrations to display current conditions and future forecasts. Our project simulates the basic functionalities of such apps, making it directly applicable in building mobile or web-based weather applications.

2. Climate Research
Researchers studying climate change can use historical weather APIs to collect large datasets over time. With data visualization tools, they can uncover patterns and anomalies in global or regional climates.

3. Education
This kind of project is ideal for teaching programming, data handling, and basic data science to beginners. It introduces students to real-world APIs and how to make sense of external data sources through coding.

4. Corporate Reporting Tools
Businesses that depend on weather data (e.g., airlines, logistics, construction) can integrate similar scripts into internal tools to make operational decisions based on weather conditions.
